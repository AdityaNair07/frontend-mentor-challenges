## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to first structure the HTML code and then use CSS styling. This makes the process easy and error free. Making use of Google Fonts effectively to enhance the page styles. Also learned responsive design that enabled the page to provide better user interface and experience on different screen resolutions.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me for developing creative and responsive design pattern.
- [Resource 2](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This is an amazing resource that helped me finally understand flex in CSS in a fun way. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
